# MCAD-MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-CYBER-ATTACK-DETECTION-IN-SDN-ENABLED-HEALTHCARE-SYSTEMS
The healthcare industry handles sensitive and important data that must be protected from 
unauthorized access. Software-defined networks (SDNs) are extensively implemented in 
healthcare systems to assure optimal resource utilization, security, network administration, and 
control. Due to the sensitivity of patient data, SDNs are exposed to a wide spectrum of intrusions 
despite their many benefits. These attacks harm the overall network performance and can lead to 
network failures that pose a risk to human lives. Therefore, we aim to propose a machine 
learning-based cyber-attack detector (MCAD) for healthcare systems, by adapting a layer three 
(L3) learning switch application to collect normal and abnormal traffic, and then deploy MCAD 
on the Ryu controller. Our findings are beneficial for enhancing the security of healthcare 
applications by mitigating the impact of cyberattacks. This work covers the testing of MCAD 
using a wide spectrum of both ML algorithms and attacks, and provides a performance 
comparison for every pair of ML algorithms/attacks to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of 
different algorithms against a specific attack. The MCAD shows impressive performance, 
achieving a good F1-score on normal and attack classes, respectively, which implies a high level 
of reliability. MCAD also achieved 5,709,692 samples per second on throughput, which reflects a 
high-performance realtime system with respect to complexity.
